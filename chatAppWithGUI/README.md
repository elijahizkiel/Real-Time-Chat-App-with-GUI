Desciption: The code process a real time chat app. We made it using networking concept to help people communicate in local host. We have a server class(Chat Server) which host a server network; and we have clientGUI class which create friendly user interface to comminicate with connect client.

To see how the code runs, here are the steps
STEP 1: Run ChatServer on you local host computer
You will get an IP CODE of the server on CONSOLE
STEP 2: Run ClientGUI class on client computers. It can 10 different computers
You will be asked to enter Name and IP of the server
